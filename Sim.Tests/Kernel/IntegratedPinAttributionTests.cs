/// M4 INTEGRATION — THE CONTROL THAT ATTRIBUTES EVERY MOVED PIN.
///
/// Three goldens move on the integrated tree (T4.4 schema v22 + M4 schema v23 +
/// the granary capacity-floor fix), and "schema only" is a claim that has to be
/// MEASURED, not asserted. This is the same control T4.4 used for its own
/// widening, run the other way round.
///
/// The control REMOVES the Empire state from a finished world and re-hashes. If
/// what comes back is the earlier pinned value byte for byte, then the Empire
/// state is the entire delta and no simulation state moved with it.
///
/// TWO LAYERS are separated, because M4 moved these pins twice for different
/// reasons: M4-A's schema v23 LAYOUT (two count prefixes, present even when the
/// tables are empty) and M4-C's founding CONTENT (the rows themselves).
///
/// M4-C GENERALISED THIS. The original control stripped the two four-byte zero
/// count prefixes off the end of the stream, which was exact while nothing wrote
/// the tables — but M4-C's founding DOES write them, and `Controls` sits
/// mid-stream rather than in the trailer, so byte-stripping no longer expresses
/// the question. Clearing the three tables does, for empty and populated worlds
/// alike, and it degenerates to exactly the old trailer strip when they are empty.
